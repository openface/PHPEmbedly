= Embedly for PHP

Embedly.php is a simple client for interfacing with the embed.ly API. (http://api.embed.ly)

== Usage

Instantiate the class by passing in the options, as supported by Embed.ly.  At the very least, a
URL is required. Other (optional) parameters such as format, maxheight, maxwidth are supported 
and can be passed into the second argument as an array.

	$params = array(
	  'format' => 'json',
	  'maxwidth' => 250,
	  'maxheight' => '350',
	);

	$embedly = new Embedly('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60og9gwKh1o',$params);

Any parameters passed into Embedly.php will be sent over to Embed.ly.

To return something usable, you'll need to call the gets method. This processes the request, and will
return a JSON object.

	print $embedly->getResponse();

Outputs the following object in the JSON format.  (unless another format is specified)

	{
	"provider_url": "http://www.youtube.com/", 
	"description": "numa", 
	"title": "Numa Numa", 
	"url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60og9gwKh1o", 
	"type": "video",
